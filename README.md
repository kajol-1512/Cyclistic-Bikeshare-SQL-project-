# Cyclistic-Bikeshare-SQL-project-

Purpose: Performed an in-depth analysis of Cyclistic’s 2024 trip data to identify and compare usage patterns between annual members and casual riders.

About Data: The datasets consists of 12 CSV files containing trip data from 2024, all with consistent column structures. The columns are: ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual. 

Analysis: To explore trends between member and casual riders, I focused on key columns such as ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, and member_casual. I utilized a combination of SQL techniques—including SELECT, UPDATE, UNION ALL, window functions, aggregate functions, subqueries, CTEs, and date/time functions—to perform the analysis and uncover key differences in riding patterns between the two user groups.
